# UFOs
Module 12
## Overview of Project: 
 The purpose of this project was to create an interactive web page, which shows the UFO data in the table format. The table has an ability to filter base on the criteria specified in the filters. 
## Results:
To perform a search, an end-user will need to input filter parameters into the filter boxes as a taxt. Once Enter key is pressed, the table with the data will only show the filtered results. 
## Summary:
I would recommend:

    * to add a functionality to filter through comments
    
    * to filter by the duration
